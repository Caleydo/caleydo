  <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Hemostasis is a physiological response that culminates in the arrest of bleeding from an injured vessel. Acute vessel injury results in its constriction to reduce the loss of blood. Under normal conditions vascular endothelium supports vasodilation, inhibits platelet adhesion and activation, suppresses coagulation, enhances fibrin cleavage and is anti-inflammatory in character. Under acute vascular trauma vasoconstrictor mechanisms predominate and the endothelium becomes prothrombotic, procoagulatory and proinflammatory in nature. This is achieved by a reduction of endothelial dilating agents: adenosine, NO and prostacyclin; and the direct action of ADP, serotonin and thromboxane on vascular smooth muscle cells to elicit their contraction (Becker, Heindl et al. 2000).&lt;br&gt;The chief trigger for the change in endothelial function that leads to the formation of haemostatic thrombus is the loss of the endothelial cell barrier between blood and ECM components (Ruggeri 2002). Circulating platelets identify and discriminate areas of endothelial lesions; here, they adhere to the exposed sub endothelium. Their interaction with the various thrombogenic substrates and locally generated or released agonists results in platelet activation. This process is described as possessing two stages, firstly, adhesion -  the initial tethering to a surface, and secondly aggregation - the platelet-platelet cohesion (Savage, Cattaneo et al. 2001).</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Initiation is the first step in the formation of the platelet plug. This occurs whenever circulating platelets are arrested and subsequently activated by exposed collagen and vWF. Several collagen binding proteins are expressed on platelets, including integrin Alpha2 Beta1, GP VI, and GP IV. Integrin Alpha2 Beta1, also known on leukocytes as VLA-2, is the major collagen receptor. It requires Mg2+ for interacting with collagen. Binding occurs via the alpha2 subunit I domain to a collagen motif with the sequence Gly-Phe-Hyp-Gly-Glu-Arg (Emsley 2000). Binding of collagen to Alpha2 Beta1 also generates the intracellular signals that contribute to platelet activation. These facilitate the engagement of the lower-affinity collagen receptor, GP VI (Keely 1996). The second platelet receptor for collagen is GP VI. This is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is the most potent receptor that generates intracellular signals. Its signaling ability is strictly dependent on its association with the Fc receptor epsilon chain, which contains Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-based Activation Motifs (ITAM). GP VI is the key player in collagen-induced platelet activation. vWF  protein is a polymeric structure of variable size. It is secreted in two directions by the endothelium - basolaterally and into the bloodstream.  Shear-induced aggregation is achieved when vWF binds via its A1 domain to GPIb (part of GPIb - IX - V), and via its A3 domain mediating collagen binding to the subendothelium. The interaction between vWF and GPIb is regulated by shear force, an increase in the shear stress results in a corresponding increase in the affinity of vWF for GPIb.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Platelet activation begins with the initial binding of adhesive ligands and of the excitatory platelet agonists (released or generated at the sites of vascular trauma) to cognate receptors on the platelet membrane (Ruggeri 2002). Intracellular signaling reactions will then enhance the adhesive and procoagulant properties of tethered platelets or of platelets circulating in the proximity. From the subendothelial adhesive substrates, collagen and possibly vWF are the main inducers of platelet activation. GP VI is the most potent collagen receptor initiating signal generation, an ability derived from its interaction with the FcRI gamma chain. This results in the phosphorylation of the gamma-chain by non-receptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family (1). The phosphotyrosine motif is recognized by the SH2 domains of Syk, a tyrosine kinase. This association activates the Syk enzyme, leading to activation (by tyrosine phosphorylation) of PLC gamma2 (2). Thrombin is an important platelet agonist generated on the membrane of stimulated platelets. Thrombin acts via cell surface Protease Activated Receptors (PARs). PARs are G-protein coupled receptors activated by a proteolytic cleavage in an extracellular loop (Vu, 1991) (3). Activated PARs signal via G alpha q (4) and via the beta:gamma component of the G-protein (5). Both stimulate PLC giving rise to PIP2 hydrolysis and consequent activation of PI3K (6). PLCgamma2 activation also gives rise to IP3 (7) which stimulates the IP3 receptor (8) leading to increased intracellular calcium. Platelet activation further results in the scramblase-mediated transport of negatively-charged phospholipids to the platelet surface. These phospholipids provide a catalytic surface (with the charge provided by phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine) for the tenase complex (formed by the activated forms of the blood coagulation factors factor VIII and factor I).</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">The tethering of platelets to the site of vascular injury is the first step in the formation of a platelet thrombus. Firm adhesion of these tethered platelets, as well as the additional recruitment of others onto their surface leads to the formation of large platelet aggregates. The formation of a thrombus is strictly dependent on the formation of interplatelet bonds.</Comment>
