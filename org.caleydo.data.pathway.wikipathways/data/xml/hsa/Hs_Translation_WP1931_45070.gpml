  <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Protein synthesis is accomplished through the process of translation of an mRNA sequence into a polypeptide chain. This process can be divided into three distinct stages:  initiation, elongation and termination. During the initiation phase, the two subunits of the ribosome are brought together to the translation start site on the mRNA where the polypeptide chain is to begin. Extension of the polypeptide chain occurs when a specific aminoacyl-tRNA, as determined by the template mRNA, binds an elongating ribosome. The protein chain is released from the ribosome when any one of three stop codons in the relevant reading frame on the mRNA is reached. Individual reactions at each one of these stages are catalyzed by a number of initiation, elongation and release factors, respectively.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Initiation of translation in the majority of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs depends on the 5'-cap (m7GpppN) and involves ribosomal scanning of the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) for an initiating AUG start codon. Therefore, this mechanism is often called cap-dependent translation initiation. Proximity to the cap, as well as the nucleotides surrounding an AUG codon, influence the efficiency of the start site recognition during the scanning process. However, if the recognition site is poor enough, scanning ribosomal subunits will ignore and skip potential starting AUGs, a phenomenon called leaky scanning. Leaky scanning allows a single mRNA to encode several proteins that differ in their amino-termini. Several eukaryotic cell and viral mRNAs initiate translation by an alternative mechanism that involves internal initiation rather than ribosomal scanning. These mRNAs contain complex nucleotide sequences, called internal ribosomal entry sites, where ribosomes bind in a cap-independent manner and start translation at the closest downstream AUG codon.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">The translation elongation cycle adds one amino acid at a time to a growing polypeptide according to the sequence of codons found in the mRNA. The next available codon on the mRNA is exposed in the aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) binding site (A site) on the 30S subunit.&lt;br&gt;A: Ternary complexes of aa -tRNA:eEF1A:GTP enter the ribosome and  enable the anticodon of the tRNA to make a codon/anticodon interaction with the A-site codon of the mRNA. B: Upon cognate recognition, the eEF1A:GTP is brought into the GTPase activating center of the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed and eEF1A:GDP leaves the ribosome. C: The peptidyl transferase center of ribosome catalyses the formation of a peptide bond between the incoming amino acid and the peptide found in the peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P site). D: In the pre-translocation state of the ribosome, the eEF2:GTP enters the ribosome, physically translocating the peptidyl-tRNA out of the A site to P site and leaves the ribosome eEF2:GDP. This action of eEF2:GTP accounts for the precise movement of the mRNA by 3 nucleotides.Consequently, deacylated tRNA is shifted to the E site.  A ribosome associated ATPase activity is proposed to stimulate the release of deacylated tRNA from the E site subsequent to translocation (Elskaya et al., 1991). In this post-translocation state, the ribosome is now ready to receive a new ternary complex.&lt;br&gt;This process is illustrated below with: an amino acyl-tRNA with an amino acid, a peptidyl-tRNA with a growing peptide, a deacylated tRNA with an -OH, and a ribosome with A,P and E sites to accommodate these three forms of tRNA.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">The arrival of any of the three stop codons (UAA, UAG and UGA) into the ribosomal A-site triggers the binding of a release factor (RF) to the ribosome and subsequent polypeptide chain release. In eukaryotes, the RF is composed of two proteins, eRF1 and eRF3. eRF1 is responsible for the hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA, while eRF3 provides a GTP-dependent function. The ribosome releases the mRNA and dissociates into its two complex subunits, which can reassemble on another molecule to begin a new round of protein synthesis. It should be noted that at present, there is no factor identified in eukaryotes that would be the functional equivalent of the bacterial ribosome release (or recycling) factor, RRF, that catalyzes dissociation of the ribosome from the mRNA following release of the polypeptide</Comment>
