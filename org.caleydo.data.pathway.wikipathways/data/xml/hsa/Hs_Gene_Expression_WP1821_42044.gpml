    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">&lt;b&gt;OVERVIEW OF TRANSCRIPTION REGULATION:&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Detailed studies of gene transcription regulation in a wide variety of eukaryotic systems has revealed the general principles and mechanisms by which cell- or tissue-specific regulation of differential gene transcription is mediated (reviewed in Naar, 2001. Kadonaga, 2004, Maston, 2006, Barolo, 2002; Roeder, 2005, Rosenfeld, 2006).  Of the three major classes of DNA polymerase involved in eukaryotic gene transcription, Polymerase II generally regulates protein-encoding genes.   Figure 1 shows a diagram of the various components involved in cell-specific regulation of Pol-II gene transcription. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Core Promoter: Pol II-regulated genes typically have a Core Promoter where Pol II and a variety of general factors bind to specific DNA motifs: &lt;br&gt;   i: the TATA box (TATA DNA sequence), which is bound by the "TATA-binding protein" (TBP).&lt;br&gt;   ii: the Initiator motif (INR), where Pol II and certain other core factors bind, is present in many Pol II-regulated genes.&lt;br&gt;   iii: the Downstream Promoter Element (DPE), which is present in a subset of Pol II genes, and where additional core factors bind.  &lt;br&gt;The core promoter binding factors are generally ubiquitously expressed, although there are exceptions to this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Proximal Promoter: immediately upstream (5') of the core promoter, Pol II target genes often have a Proximal Promoter region that spans up to 500 base pairs (b.p.), or even to 1000 b.p..  This region contains a number of functional DNA binding sites for a specific set of transcription activator (TA) and transcription repressor (TR) proteins.  These TA and TR factors are generally cell- or tissue-specific in expression, rather than ubiquitous, so that the presence of their cognate binding sites in the proximal promoter region programs cell- or tissue-specific expression of the target gene, perhaps in conjunction with TA and TR complexes bound in distal enhancer regions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Distal Enhancer(s): many or most Pol II regulated genes in higher eukaryotes have one or more distal Enhancer regions which are essential for proper regulation of the gene, often in a cell or tissue-specific pattern.  Like the proximal promoter region, each of the distal enhancer regions typically contain a cluster of binding sites for specific TA and/or TR DNA-binding factors, rather than just a single site. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Enhancers generally have three defining characteristics:&lt;br&gt;     i: They can be located very long distances from the promoter of the target gene they regulate, sometimes as far as 100 Kb, or more.&lt;br&gt;     ii: They can be either upstream (5') or downstream (3') of the target gene, including within introns of that gene.&lt;br&gt;     iii: They can function in either orientation in the DNA.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combinatorial mechanisms of transcription regulation: The specific combination of TA and TR binding sites within the proximal promoter and/or distal enhancer(s) provides a "combinatorial transcription code" that mediates cell- or tissue-specific expression of the associated target gene.  Each promoter or enhancer region mediates expression in a specific subset of the overall expression pattern.  In at least some cases, each enhancer region functions completely independently of the others, so that the overall expression pattern is a linear combination of the expression patterns of each of the enhancer modules.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Co-Activator and Co-Repressor Complexes:  DNA-bound TA and TR proteins typically recruit the assembly of specific Co-Activator (Co-A) and Co-Repressor (Co-R) Complexes, respectively, which are essential for regulating target gene transcription.  Both Co-A's and Co-R's  are multi-protein complexes that contain several specific protein components.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Co-Activator complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone Acetyl Transferase (HAT) enzymatic activity.  This functions to acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors, which typically increases that transcription activation of the target gene.  By contrast, Co-Repressor complexes generally contain at lease one component protein that has Histone De-Acetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity.  This functions to de-acetylate Histones and/or other chromatin-associated factors. This typically increases the transcription repression of the target gene.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adaptor (Mediator) complexes: In addition to the co-activator complexes that assemble on particular cell-specific TA factors,  - there are at least two additional transcriptional co-activator complexes common to most cells.  One of these is the Mediator complex, which functions as an "adaptor" complex that bridges between the tissue-specific co-activator complexes assembled in the proximal promoter (or distal enhancers).  The human Mediator complex has been shown to contain at least 19 protein distinct components.  Different combinations of these co-activator proteins are also found to be components of specific transcription Co-Activator complexes, such as the DRIP, TRAP and ARC complexes described below.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;TBP/TAF complex: Another large Co-A complex is the "TBP-associated factors" (TAFs) that assemble on TBP (TATA-Binding Protein), which is bound to the TATA box present in many promoters.  There are at least 23 human TAF proteins that have been identified.  Many of these are ubiquitously expressed, but TAFs can also be expressed in a cell or tissue-specific pattern.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;


&lt;b&gt;	Specific Coactivator Complexes for DNA-binding Transcription Factors.&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A number of specific co-activator complexes for DNA-binding transcription factors have been identified, including DRIP, TRAP, and ARC (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004, Blazek, 2005, Conaway, 2005, and Malik, 2005).  The DRIP co-activator complex was originally identified and named as a specific complex associated with the Vitamin D Receptor member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors (Rachez, 1998).  Similarly, the TRAP co-activator complex was originally identified as a complex that associates with the thyroid receptor (Yuan, 1998).   It was later determined that all of the components of the DRIP complex are also present in the TRAP complex, and the ARC complex (discussed further below).  For example, the DRIP205 and TRAP220 proteins were show to be identical, as were specific pairs of the other components of these complexes (Rachez, 1999).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition, these various transcription co-activator proteins identified in mammalian cells were found to be the orthologues or homologues of the Mediator ("adaptor") complex proteins (reviewed in Bourbon, 2004).  The Mediator proteins were originally identified in yeast  by Kornberg and colleagues, as complexes associated with DNA polymerase (Kelleher, 1990).  In higher organisms, Adapter complexes bridge between the basal transcription factors (including Pol II) and tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs) bound to sites within upstream Proximal Promoter regions or distal Enhancer regions (Figure 1).  However, many of the Mediator homologues can also be found in complexes associated with specific transcription factors in higher organisms.  A unified nomenclature system for these adapter / co-activator proteins now labels them Mediator 1 through Mediator 31 (Bourbon, 2004).  For example, the DRIP205 / TRAP220 proteins are now identified as Mediator 1 (Rachez, 1999), based on homology with yeast Mediator 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



&lt;b&gt;Example Pathway: Specific Regulation of Target Genes During Notch Signaling:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One well-studied example of cell-specific regulation of gene transcription is selective regulation of target genes during Notch signaling.  Notch signaling was first identified in Drosophila, where it has been studied in detail at the genetic, molecular, biochemical and cellular levels (reviewed in Justice, 2002; Bray, 2006; Schweisguth, 2004; Louvri, 2006).  In Drosophila, Notch signaling to the nucleus is thought always to be mediated by one specific DNA binding transcription factor, Suppressor of Hairless.  In mammals, the homologous genes are called CBF1 (or RBPJkappa), while in worms they are called Lag-1, so that the acronym "CSL" has been given to this conserved transcription factor family.  There are at least two human CSL homologues, which are now named RBPJ and RBPJL.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Drosophila, Su(H) is known to be bifunctional, in that it represses target gene transcription in the absence of Notch signaling, but activates target genes during Notch signaling.  At least some of the mammalian CSL homologues are believed also to be bifunctional, and to mediate target gene repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and activation in the presence of Notch signaling.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Notch Co-Activator and Co-Repressor complexes: This repression is mediated by at least one specific co-repressor complexes (Co-R) bound to CSL in the absence of Notch signaling.  In Drosophila, this co-repressor complex consists of at least three distinct co-repressor proteins: Hairless, Groucho, and dCtBP (Drosophila C-terminal Binding Protein).  Hairless has been show to bind directly to Su(H), and Groucho and dCtBP have been shown to bind directly to Hairless (Barolo, 2002).  All three of the co-repressor proteins have been shown to be necessary for proper gene regulation during Notch signaling in vivo (Nagel, 2005).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In mammals, the same general pathway and mechanisms are observed, where CSL proteins are bifunctional DNA binding transcription factors (TFs), that bind to Co-Repressor complexes to mediate repression in the absence of Notch signaling, and bind to Co-Activator  complexes to mediate activation in the presence of Notch signaling.  However, in mammals, there may be multiple co-repressor complexes, rather than the single Hairless co-repressor complex that has been observed in Drosophila.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During Notch signaling in all systems, the Notch transmembrane receptor is cleaved and the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) translocates to the nucleus, where it there functions as a specific transcription co-activator for CSL proteins.  In the nucleus, NICD replaces the Co-R complex bound to CSL, thus resulting in de-repression of  Notch target genes in the nucleus (Figure 2).  Once bound to CSL, NICD and CSL proteins recruit an additional co-activator protein, Mastermind, to form a CSL-NICD-Mam ternary co-activator (Co-A) complex.  This Co-R  complex was initially thought to be sufficient to mediate activation of  at least some Notch target genes.  However, there now is evidence that still other co-activators and additional DNA-binding transcription factors are required in at least some contexts (reviewed in Barolo, 2002).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, CSL is a good example of a bifunctional DNA-binding transcription factor that mediates repression of specific targets genes in one context, but activation of the same targets in another context.  This bifunctionality is mediated by the association of specific Co-Repressor complexes vs. specific Co-Activator complexes in different contexts, namely in the absence or presence of Notch signaling.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">tRNA synthetases catalyze the ligation of tRNAs to their cognate amino acids in an ATP-dependent manner. The reaction proceeds in two steps. First, amino acid and ATP form an aminoacyl adenylate molecule, releasing pyrophosphate. The aminoacyl adenylate remains associated with the synthetase enzyme where, in the second step it reacts with tRNA to form aminoacyl tRNA and AMP. The rapid hydrolysis of pyrophosphate makes these reactions essentially irreversible under physiological conditions (Fersht and Kaethner 1976a). Specificity of the tRNA charging reactions is achieved both by specific recognition of amino acid and tRNA substrates by the synthetase, and by an editing process in which incorrect aminoacyl adenylate molecules (e.g., valyl adenylate associated with isoleucyl tRNA synthetase) are hydrolyzed rather than conjugated to tRNAs in the second step of the reaction (Baldwin and Berg 1966a,b; Fersht and Kaethner 1976b). The tRNA synthetases can be divided into two structural classes based on conserved amino acid sequence features (Burnbaum and Schimmel 1991).&lt;p&gt;A single synthetase mediates the charging of all of the tRNA species specific for any one amino acid but, with three exceptions, glycine, lysine, and glutamine, the synthetase that catalyzes aminoacylation of mitochondrial tRNAs is encoded by a different gene than the one that acts on mitochondrial tRNAs. Both mitochondrial and cytosolic tRNA synthetase enzymes are encoded by genes in the nuclear genome.&lt;p&gt;A number of tRNA synthetases are known to have functions distinct from tRNA charging (reviewed by Park et al. 2005). Additionally, mutations in several of the tRNA synthetases, often affecting protein domains that are dispensable in vitro for aminoacyl tRNA synthesis, are associated with a diverse array of neurological and other diseases (Antonellis and Green 2008; Park et al. 2008). These findings raise interest into the role of these enzymes in human development and disease.&lt;p&gt;</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">The 5'-ends of all eukaryotic pre-mRNAs studied thus far are converted to cap structures. The cap is thought to influence splicing of the first intron, and is bound by 'cap-binding' proteins, CBP80 and CBP20, in the nucleus. The cap is important for translation initiation, and it also interacts with the poly(A)terminus, via proteins, resulting in circularization of the mRNA to facilitate multiple rounds of translation. The cap is also important for mRNA stability, protecting it from 5' to 3' nucleases, and is required for mRNA export to the cytoplasm.&lt;BR&gt;The capping reaction usually occurs very rapidly on nascent transcripts; after the synthesis of only a few nucleotides by RNA polymerase II. The capping reaction involves the conversion of the 5'-end of the nascent transcript from a triphosphate to a diphosphate by a RNA 5'-triphosphatase, followed by the addition of a guanosine monophosphate by the mRNA guanylyltransferase, to form a 5'-5'-triphosphate linkage. This cap is then methylated by 2'-O-methyltransferases.&lt;P&gt;</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Initiation of translation in the majority of eukaryotic cellular mRNAs depends on the 5'-cap (m7GpppN) and involves ribosomal scanning of the 5' untranslated region (5'-UTR) for an initiating AUG start codon. Therefore, this mechanism is often called cap-dependent translation initiation. Proximity to the cap, as well as the nucleotides surrounding an AUG codon, influence the efficiency of the start site recognition during the scanning process. However, if the recognition site is poor enough, scanning ribosomal subunits will ignore and skip potential starting AUGs, a phenomenon called leaky scanning. Leaky scanning allows a single mRNA to encode several proteins that differ in their amino-termini. Several eukaryotic cell and viral mRNAs initiate translation by an alternative mechanism that involves internal initiation rather than ribosomal scanning. These mRNAs contain complex nucleotide sequences, called internal ribosomal entry sites, where ribosomes bind in a cap-independent manner and start translation at the closest downstream AUG codon.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">The translation elongation cycle adds one amino acid at a time to a growing polypeptide according to the sequence of codons found in the mRNA. The next available codon on the mRNA is exposed in the aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) binding site (A site) on the 30S subunit.&lt;br&gt;A: Ternary complexes of aa -tRNA:eEF1A:GTP enter the ribosome and  enable the anticodon of the tRNA to make a codon/anticodon interaction with the A-site codon of the mRNA. B: Upon cognate recognition, the eEF1A:GTP is brought into the GTPase activating center of the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed and eEF1A:GDP leaves the ribosome. C: The peptidyl transferase center of ribosome catalyses the formation of a peptide bond between the incoming amino acid and the peptide found in the peptidyl-tRNA binding site (P site). D: In the pre-translocation state of the ribosome, the eEF2:GTP enters the ribosome, physically translocating the peptidyl-tRNA out of the A site to P site and leaves the ribosome eEF2:GDP. This action of eEF2:GTP accounts for the precise movement of the mRNA by 3 nucleotides.Consequently, deacylated tRNA is shifted to the E site.  A ribosome associated ATPase activity is proposed to stimulate the release of deacylated tRNA from the E site subsequent to translocation (Elskaya et al., 1991). In this post-translocation state, the ribosome is now ready to receive a new ternary complex.&lt;br&gt;This process is illustrated below with: an amino acyl-tRNA with an amino acid, a peptidyl-tRNA with a growing peptide, a deacylated tRNA with an -OH, and a ribosome with A,P and E sites to accommodate these three forms of tRNA.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">The arrival of any of the three stop codons (UAA, UAG and UGA) into the ribosomal A-site triggers the binding of a release factor (RF) to the ribosome and subsequent polypeptide chain release. In eukaryotes, the RF is composed of two proteins, eRF1 and eRF3. eRF1 is responsible for the hydrolysis of the peptidyl-tRNA, while eRF3 provides a GTP-dependent function. The ribosome releases the mRNA and dissociates into its two complex subunits, which can reassemble on another molecule to begin a new round of protein synthesis. It should be noted that at present, there is no factor identified in eukaryotes that would be the functional equivalent of the bacterial ribosome release (or recycling) factor, RRF, that catalyzes dissociation of the ribosome from the mRNA following release of the polypeptide</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Co-transcriptional pre-mRNA splicing is not obligatory. Pre-mRNA splicing begins co-transcriptionally and often continues post-transcriptionally. Human genes contain an average of nine introns per gene, which cannot serve as splicing substrates until both 5' and 3' ends of each intron are synthesized. Thus the time that it takes for pol II to synthesize each intron defines a minimal time and distance along the gene in which splicing factors can be recruited. The time that it takes for pol II to reach the end of the gene defines the maximal time in which splicing could occur co-transcriptionally. Thus, the kinetics of transcription can affect the kinetics of splicing.Any covalent change in a primary (nascent) mRNA transcript is mRNA Processing.  For successful gene expression, the primary mRNA transcript needs to be converted to a mature mRNA prior to its translation into polypeptide.  Eucaryotic mRNAs undergo a series of complex processing reactions; these begin on nascent transcripts as soon as a few ribonucleotides have been synthesized during transcription by RNA Polymerase II, through the export of the mature mRNA to the cytoplasm, and culminate with mRNA turnover in the cytoplasm.</Comment>

There are two classes of intronless pre-mRNAs (mRNAs expressed from genes that lack introns). The first class encodes the replication dependent histone mRNAs.  These mRNAs have unique 3' ends that do not have a polyA tail.  The replication dependent histone mRNAs in all metazoans, as well as Chlamydomonas and Volvox fall into this class. &lt;p&gt;The second class of mRNAs end in polyA tails, which are formed by a  mechanism similar to that which poly-adenylate pre-mRNAs containing introns. In the intronless genes there is a different method of replacing the 3' splice site that activates polyadenylation.</Comment>
