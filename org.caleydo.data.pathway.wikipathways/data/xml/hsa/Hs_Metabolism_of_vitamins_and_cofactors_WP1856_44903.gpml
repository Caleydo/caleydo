  <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Vitamins are a diverse group of organic compounds, required in small amounts in the diet. They have distinct biochemical roles, often as coenzymes, and are either not synthesized or synthesized only in limited amounts by human cells. Vitamins are classified according to their solubility, either fat-soluble or water-soluble. The physiological processes dependent on vitamin-requiring reactions include many aspects of intermediary metabolism, vision, bone formation, and blood coagulation, and vitamin deficiencies are associated with a correspondingly diverse and severe group of diseases. The metabolism of water-soluble vitamins and of vitamin D are annotated in Reactome.</Comment>

    <Comment Source="WikiPathways-description">Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is a steroid hormone that plays a role in regulating calcium and bone metabolism. It is obtained from the diet and produced in the skin by photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol and released into the bloodstream. Only a few food sources have significant amounts of vitamins D2 and D3 but many foodstuffs nowadays are fortified with vitamin D. The metabolites of vitamin D3 are carried in the circulation bound to a plasma protein called vitamin D binding protein (VDBP).  Vitamin D3 undergoes two subsequent hydroxylations to form the active form of the vitamin, 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 (calcitriol). The first hydroxylation takes place in the liver and subsequent transport to the kidney allows the second hydroxylation. Calciferol acts by binding to nuclear vitamin D receptors.</Comment>

Metabolic processes annotated here include the synthesis of thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP) from thiamin (B1), the synthesis of FMN and FAD from riboflavin (B2), the synthesis of nicotinic acid (niacin - B3) from tryptophan, the synthesis of Coenzyme A from pantothenate (B5), and features of the metabolism of folate (B9).</Comment>
