<h2><a name="ParallelCoordinates"></a>Parallel Coordinates</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/parcoords.png"
	alt="Parallel coordinates icon"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /> <img
	src="../images/help/gene_expression/parallel_coordinates.png"
	alt="Parallel coordinates"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" />
Parallel coordinates visualize multidimensional data by drawing lines
between a set of axis. Each line represents one entity, typically a
gene. Each axis a dimension, typically an experiment. When one gene is
viewed in the parallel coordinates, all it's expression values for the
experiments are visible simultaneously. By drawing multiple lines at the
same time, trends in a dataset can be identified. In the screen-shot a
dense (dark) area around the bottom shows that many genes have
expression values in this area.</p>
<p>In parallel coordinates you can select the polylines as well as
the axis. Selections and some brief information is shown in the <a
	href="user_interface.html#SideBar">Info Area</a>.</p>

<h3>Rearranging axis</h3>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/drop.png"
	alt="Axis drop"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> To
make an accurate comparison between two different experiments it is
often necessary to place them side by side. Therefore it is important to
be able to re-arrange and duplicate, possibly also remove unneeded
experiments.</p>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/reset_axis_spacing.png"
	alt="Reset the axis spacing"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" />The
parallel coordinates use a drop below the axis, shown in the picture on
the right to achieve this task. By default the drop is shown in a small,
simplified version. Once the mouse is placed over it, it changes to the
version containing three buttons. By clicking the left button, the
associated axis is <b>duplicated</b>. By clicking the right button, the
axis is <b>removed</b>. By dragging the central button to the sides, the
axis is dragged along and consequently <b>rearranged</b>. When dragging
around axes, the spacing between the axes can become uneven. To balance
the spacing between the axes again, click the icon shown on the left in
the tool bar.</p>

<h3>Filtering</h3>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/drop_gate.png"
	alt="Filter drop"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" />The
parallel coordinates support three types of filters, a one dimensional
filter, a global filter and an angular filter.</p>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/gate.png" alt="Filter"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" />The <b>one
dimensional filter</b> allows you to remove all genes that are smaller
and/or larger then a specified value. To activate the brush for a
particular axis click the small drop on top of the axis (shown on the
right). This makes the filter, as shown on the left appear.</p>
<p>To change the height of the filter, click the black labels with
the caption and drag them up or down. This adjusts the size of the
filter an thereby adds or removes polylines. By dragging the body of the
filter the top and the bottom are moved simultaneously.</p>
<p>To remove the brush click the handle right of the top label.</p>
<p>The <b>global filter</b> works excatly the same, but has
different consequences. To activate the global filter, click the drop at
the tip of the line on the far left of the parallel coordinates. Again,
the filter appears.</p>
<p>This filter allows to remove all lines that never leave a
specified corridor. This helps to remove those genes, that are neither
over- nor underexpressed in any experiment. It removes all polylines
that don't leave the spanned region in any of the experimental
conditions currently visible. So, if you set this filter to span the
region between 1 and 3, all genes, that only have expression values
between 1 and 3 are removed. If only one value for that gene is smaller
or bigger, the gene is not removed.</p>

<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/angular_brush.png"
	alt="Angular Filter"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /> <img
	src="../images/help/gene_expression/angular_brush_screenshot.png"
	alt="Angular Filter"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" />The <b>angular
filter</b> can be used to identify discontinuities between two experiments.
It allows you to remove all lines, that are not similar to a certain
slope of a master line. First click on the icon for the angular brush in
the toolbar (shown on the left). Then click on a polyline, between two
axis where it has a slope which you would like to use as the basis for
your filter. Once you clicked the polyline, the brush appears, as shown
on the right.</p>
<p>By dragging the legs up or down, you can adjust the level of
tolerance for matching the slope of other polylines.</p>

<h3>Swapping Dimensions</h3>
TODO: image
<p>When using parallel coordinates, it is possible to show the data
in two different ways. In our case we have experiments and genes. Both
can be the axes or the polylines, but exchanging them produces radically
different results. Showing genes as axes is desired when differences
between the experiments are of interest. One example is the comparison
of gene expression patterns from carcinogenic tissue with healthy
tissue. However, when discontinuities of gene expression over several
experiments are of interest, it is beneficial to show the experiments as
axes. As an example, consider a user is interested in different
expression values of a small number of genes in many different
experimental conditions.</p>
