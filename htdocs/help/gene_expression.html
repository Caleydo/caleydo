<h2><a name="ParallelCoordinates"></a>Parallel Coordinates</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/parcoords.png"
	alt="Parallel coordinates icon"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /> <img
	src="../images/help/gene_expression/parallel_coordinates.png"
	alt="Parallel coordinates"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" />
Parallel coordinates visualize multidimensional data by drawing lines
between a set of axis. Each line represents one entity, typically a
gene. Each axis a dimension, typically an experiment. When one gene is
viewed in the parallel coordinates, all it's expression values for the
experiments are visible simultaneously. By drawing multiple lines at the
same time, trends in a dataset can be identified. In the screen-shot a
dense (dark) area around the bottom shows that many genes have
expression values in this area.</p>
<p>In parallel coordinates you can select the polylines as well as
the axis. Selections and some brief information is shown in the <a
	href="user_interface.html#SideBar">Info Area</a>.</p>

<h3>Rearranging axis</h3>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/drop.png"
	alt="Axis drop"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> To
make an accurate comparison between two different experiments it is
often necessary to place them side by side. Therefore it is important to
be able to re-arrange and duplicate, possibly also remove unneeded
experiments.</p>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/reset_axis_spacing.png"
	alt="Reset the axis spacing"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" />The
parallel coordinates use a drop below the axis, shown in the picture on
the right to achieve this task. By default the drop is shown in a small,
simplified version. Once the mouse is placed over it, it changes to the
version containing three buttons. By clicking the left button, the
associated axis is <b>duplicated</b>. By clicking the right button, the
axis is <b>removed</b>. By dragging the central button to the sides, the
axis is dragged along and consequently <b>rearranged</b>. When dragging
around axes, the spacing between the axes can become uneven. To balance
the spacing between the axes again, click the icon shown on the left in
the tool bar.</p>

<h3>Filtering</h3>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/drop_gate.png"
	alt="Filter drop"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" />The
parallel coordinates support three types of filters, a one dimensional
filter, a global filter and an angular filter.</p>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/gate.png" alt="Filter"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" />The <b>one
dimensional filter</b> allows you to remove all genes that are smaller
and/or larger then a specified value. To activate the brush for a
particular axis click the small drop on top of the axis (shown on the
right). This makes the filter, as shown on the left appear.</p>
<p>To change the height of the filter, click the black labels with
the caption and drag them up or down. This adjusts the size of the
filter an thereby adds or removes polylines. By dragging the body of the
filter the top and the bottom are moved simultaneously.</p>
<p>To remove the brush click the handle right of the top label.</p>
<p>The <b>global filter</b> works excatly the same, but has
different consequences. To activate the global filter, click the drop at
the tip of the line on the far left of the parallel coordinates. Again,
the filter appears.</p>
<p>This filter allows to remove all lines that never leave a
specified corridor. This helps to remove those genes, that are neither
over- nor underexpressed in any experiment. It removes all polylines
that don't leave the spanned region in any of the experimental
conditions currently visible. So, if you set this filter to span the
region between 1 and 3, all genes, that only have expression values
between 1 and 3 are removed. If only one value for that gene is smaller
or bigger, the gene is not removed.</p>

<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/angular_brush.png"
	alt="Angular Filter"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /> <img
	src="../images/help/gene_expression/angular_brush_screenshot.png"
	alt="Angular Filter"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" />The <b>angular
filter</b> can be used to identify discontinuities between two experiments.
It allows you to remove all lines, that are not similar to a certain
slope of a master line. First click on the icon for the angular brush in
the toolbar (shown on the left). Then click on a polyline, between two
axis where it has a slope which you would like to use as the basis for
your filter. Once you clicked the polyline, the brush appears, as shown
on the right.</p>
<p>By dragging the legs up or down, you can adjust the level of
tolerance for matching the slope of other polylines.</p>

<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/clear_selections.png"
	alt="Clear Selections"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /> To <b>clear
selections and filters</b> press the clear selections icon. This will remove
all filters, mouse-over and clicked selections you previously applied.</p>

<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/save_selections.png"
	alt="Save Brushes"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /> The <b>save
filters</b> feature allows you to actually remove all items that you
currently filtered out. This is useful, if you handle a lot of data and
want to continue working with a subset. Also, if you want to export your
filtered data you have to press this button first. The same is true for
swapping dimensions and bookmarking genes, which will be explained
later.</p>

<h3>Bookmarking</h3>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/bookmark.png"
	alt="Bookmarking"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /> <img
	src="../images/help/gene_expression/bookmark_screenshot.png"
	alt="Bookmarking screenshot"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> By
clicking the bookmark icon, all elements which are not currently
filtered out are added to the bookmark bar, which appears on the right,
once it is filled with content. Notice however, that you can only
bookmark 20 items or less, so you have to modify your filters to show
less than 20 items.</p>
<p>If you want to bookmark genes individually, you can right-click
on a gene, which makes the context menu appear and bookmark it from
there.</p>
<p>The bookmarks are synchronized with the bucket. Any element that
appears in this bookmark bar is also visible in the buckets bookmark
bar.</p>

<h3>Resetting the View</h3>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/reset_view.png"
	alt="Save Brushes"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" />By
clicking the reset button, the view is reset to its initial state. All
re-arranged axes, all removed polylines are added again.</p>

<h3>Swapping Dimensions</h3>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/change_orientation.png"
	alt="Swap dimensions"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /> <img
	src="../images/help/gene_expression/pcs_after.png"
	alt="Swap dimensions"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> <img
	src="../images/help/gene_expression/pcs_before.png"
	alt="Swap dimensions"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> When
using parallel coordinates, it is possible to show the data in two
different ways. In our case we have experiments and genes. Both can be
the axes or the polylines, but exchanging them produces radically
different results. Showing genes as axes is desired when differences
between the experiments are of interest. One example is the comparison
of gene expression patterns from carcinogenic tissue with healthy
tissue. However, when discontinuities of gene expression over several
experiments are of interest, it is beneficial to show the experiments as
axes. As an example, consider beeing interested in different expression
values of a small number of genes in many different experimental
conditions.</p>
<p>In Caleydo you can switch between what the parallel coordinates
treat as axes and what as polylines. In the left picture you see 13
experiments treated as axes. The number of genes has been reduced to 6.
By clicking the switch dimensions button the picture on the right is
produced. Now the 6 genes which were polylines in the left picture are
now axes in the right, and vice versa.</p>
<p>This feature is also particularly useful if you only have a view
genes, but many experiments. Then you can switch dimensions immediately
and analyze the differences of the experiments at a glance.</p>

<h2><a name="HeatMap"></a>Heat Map</h2>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/heatmap.png"
	alt="Heat map icon"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /> <img
	src="../images/help/gene_expression/hhm.png" alt="Heat map screenshot"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> The
heat map is a visualization that maps a color to the magnitude of a
value. One gene corresponds to one row, and one experiment to one
column.</p>
<p>A heat map is especially useful, if the underlying data is <a
	href="#Clustering">clustered</a>. Clustering gives the ordering of
elements meaning. Elements close to each other have similar properties
(and therefore also similar color).</p>
<p>The heat map in Caleydo makes use of this. Its three levels (two
for smaller amounts of data) allow you to browse thousands of values. On
the left side, a thin overview bar shows all values. In this overview
trends are visible. The overview bar can contain up to 30,000 values.</p>
<p>The second level shows an enlarged version of the area selected
in the overview bar. This level contains up to 1,000 values. Here trends
and differences are clearly visible.</p>
<p>The final level contains less than 100 values. Genes and
experiments are labeled an all detail is visible.</p>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/hhm_overview.png"
	alt="Heat map handle bars"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> The
width of the second level can be adjusted by clicking the arrow button
between the second and third level. To select which part of the overview
should be shown in the detailed levels simply click the region.</p>
<p>The amount of data to be shown in the last level can be adjusted
by dragging the handle bars shown on the right. Dragging the grey area
between the handles lets you scroll through the overview smoothly.</p>

<p><b>Selections</b> are handled <a
	href="user_interface.htlm#SelectingElements">the same way</a> as in all
other views. Additionaly, indications of selections are also shown on
the first and second level, by displaying colored bars respectively
lines. When a selection is triggered by another linked view, the second
and third layer jump directly to the selected element. In case of
multiple selections, the heat map jumps to the first, and the others are
indicated in the second and third level.</p>


<h2><a name="Clustering"></a>Clustering</h2>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/clustering.png"
	alt="Clustering icon"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /> <img
	src="../images/help/gene_expression/clustering_screenshot.png"
	alt="Clustering GUI screenshot"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" />
Caleydo currently supports four clustering algorithms, two partitional
(where no relation between the separate cluster is known) and two
hierarchical (which build a complete tree of relations):</p>
<ul>
	<li>A tree clusterer, using similarities (hierarchical),</li>
	<li>affinity propagation clustering, which usually delivers the
	best results (partitional),</li>
	<li>KMeans clustering, as implemented by WEKA (hierarchical), and</li>
	<li>Cobweb, as implemented by WEKA (partitional).</li>
</ul>
<p>All algorithms can be used to cluster either the genes, the
experiments or both (bi-clustering).</p>
<p>Two different distance measures are available: the euclidian
distance and the pearson correlation.</p>
<p>Affinity propagation lets you choose a factor which influences
the number of clusters returned, which may be between 1 and 10. KMeans
requires you to specify the number of clusters.</p>
<p>When you have chosen the clustering algorithm and the parameters,
press OK. A status bar will pop up, displaying the progress of the
algorithm. Depending on the algorithm and the size of the data this
process can take a while. Once clustering is complete, the heat map will
show the updated ordering of the elements.</p>

<h2><a name="TabularDataViewer"></a>Tabular Data Viewer</h2>
<p><img src="../images/help/gene_expression/tabular_data_viewer.png"
	alt="Tabular data viewer icon"
	style="border-style: none; float: left; padding-right: 1em;" /><img
	src="../images/help/gene_expression/tabular.png"
	alt="Tabular data viewer screen shot"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;padding-bottom: 1em;" /> The
tabular data viewer is a table containing the original values. It is
synchronized with the rest of the system and always jumps to the
currently active value.</p>
<p>The gene short name and the RefSeq ID are always shown in the two
leftmost columns. Furthermore you can delete columns by pressing the
button at the bottom of the column.</p>
