<h2><a name="Prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Caleydo visualizes thousands of data points and therefore is a
resource intensive application and requires somewhat recent hardware.
The system requirements vary widely with the amount of data you want to
load and visualize simultaneously. For a detailed discussion on the
scalability of Caleydo please refer to the <a href="#Scalability">section
at the end of this page</a>. We recommend the following hardware and
software configurations:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A graphics card with at least 64 MB RAM is recommended.</li>
	<li>Up to date graphics card drivers</li>
	<li>Currently only Sun Java 6 is supported. Download and install
	the latest <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java
	Runtime Environment</a>. OpenJDK is not supported</li>
	<li>Supported operating systems: Windows and Linux. Mac Operating
	Systems are not supported (though it should theoretically run).</li>
	<li>A mouse with a mouse wheel.</li>
	<li>For the first start only: a broadband Internet connection.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="Installation"></a>Installation</h2>

<h3>Webstart</h3>
<p>Java Webstart allows you to run Caleydo without the need to
install it. All the files will be downloaded automatically to your
computer and Caleydo will start automatically once download is complete.</p>
<p>To run Caleydo as a webstart application, make sure you have Java
installed and then simply click the large web start icon on the <a
	href="index.html">home</a> or the <a href="downloads.html">downloads</a>
page.</p>
<p>The application now downloads to your local hard drive and then
executes. Note that you do not need to have administrator privileges to
do that.</p>
<p>Using web start ensures that you always have the most current
version of Caleydo.</p>

<h3>Manual Installation</h3>
<p>To manually install Caleydo download the compressed file
appropriate for your operating system from the <a href="downloads.html">download
page</a>. Extract the archive, enter the created Caleydo folder and click
the executable (caleydo.exe on Windows).</p>


<h2><a name="Startup"></a>Startup</h2>

<p><img src="../images/help/project_wizard.png" alt="Project Wizard"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> Upon
startup you are presented with choices for different execution modes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Genetic Analysis and</li>
	<li>General Data Analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>While the former is tailored to the analysis of microarray gene
expression data and pathways, the latter can load any kind of csv file.
Of course, the pathways are not available in the general data analysis
mode.</p>
<p>The genetic analysis page currently lets you choose between three
options:</p>
<ol>
	<li><b>Start with sample gene expression data.</b> This starts
	Caleydo with a set of clustered gene expression data.</li>
	<li><b>Start with random generated sample gene expression data</b>
	starts Caleydo with a set of random data.</li>
	<li><b>Load data from file</b> let you load your own microarray
	data, as long as it adheres to the following criteria specified in <a
		href="#DataFormat">Data Format</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, a check box let's you choose whether you want to load
pathways for the analysis (which makes startup slower) or not.</p>

<p>In case of <b>General Data Analysis</b> you currently have only
the option to load comma separated data.</p>

<h2><a name="FirstRun"></a>First Run, Pathway Fetching</h2>

<p><img src="../images/help/pathway_fetching.png"
	alt="Pathway Fetching"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> When
you start Caleydo for the first time in Genetic Analysis mode with
pathways enabled (see <a href="#Startup">Startup</a>) you will be asked
to fetch the pathways from <a href="http://www.biocarta.com/Biocarta">BioCarta</a>
and <a href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/">KEGG</a>. Click <i>Fetch
pathways</i> to start the process. Caleydo will then load the pathways from
the databases and store them on your local computer.</p>
<p>The download will not surpass 30MB, but will exceed 1000 files.
The data is stored in your users home directory in a folder called <code>.caleydo</code>.</p>
<p>When the download is complete click <i>Finish</i>. You will need
to do this only once, but you can manually redo it to update the pathway
database via the preferences.</p>
<p>In case you update Caleydo from a previous version, pathway
fetching can be necessary as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
</p>


<h2><a name="DataFormat"></a>Data Format</h2>
<p>To analyze gene expression data in Caleydo the data currently has
to be provided in a specific way:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>File Format:</b> Comma separated files (as can be exported
	from for example Microsoft Excel) with the extensions of *.csv or *.txt
	are supported.</li>
	<li><b>Delimiters:</b> Any kind of delimiter is possible. The most
	common are TAB and Semicolon.</li>
	<li><b>Header:</b> The file may contain a header, which can be
	ignored upon import</li>
	<li><b>Identifier:</b> The first column in the file <b>has to
	contain NCBI Accession numbers with the prefix NM</b>. While it is legal to
	have rows without accession number in the file, those values will not
	be available during the analysis.</li>
	<li><b>Columns:</b> The file may contain columns with other data,
	such as gene short names. Those columns will have to be deselected upon
	import.</li>
	<li><b>Values:</b> Any real value is legal. The decimal symbol is
	period (.) not comma (,). 0.3445 is a legal value, 0,3445 is not. Non
	existing values are legal. They can either be left blank or be
	specified as NaN (not a number).</li>
	<li><b>Column captions:</b> The row before the actual values has
	to contain column captions (this would be the first line in the file,
	if no header is present). It is legal (but unwise) to leave them blank</li>
	<li><b>Length:</b> All columns are of equal length</li>
</ul>



<h2><a name="Dataloading"></a>Data Loading</h2>
<p><img src="../images/help/data_import.png"
	alt="Data loader screenshot"
	style="border-style: none; float: right; padding-left: 1em;" /> To
select a data file click the <i>Choose data file</i> button. You now get
a file dialog where you can navigate to your .csv or .txt file.</p>
<p>Once loaded you can see a preview of your data in the table. If
you have a delimiter different then TAB you have to specify the
delimiter, which will automatically update the preview.</p>
<p>If you have a header in your file, adjust the number of ignored
lines by editing the <i>Ignore lines in header</i> text field.</p>
<p>Data can be logarithmized (log10 and log2 are available). By
using this filter, the original data remains untouched, and you will
also see the original values in the visualization. However,
visualizations, for example diagrams will display the data
logarithmized.</p>
<p>The <i>min</i> and <i>max</i> options are disabled by default. If
you want to clip your data to a certain range use min and max to do
that. All values greater then max resp. smaller than min will be
displayed as max resp. min in the visualizations.</p>

<p>If you have data that you don't want to import uncheck the
checkbox on to of the column. You have to uncheck any columns containing
text etc.</p>

<p>Now click <b>Finish</b> and Caleydo will begin to load the data.</p>

<h2><a name="Scalability"></a>Scalability</h2>
<p>The performance of Caleydo varies with the hardware you use, the
type of your data and the size of the data.</p>
<p>Loading of large data files, of the mappings and the pathway
graphs needed for genetic pathway analysis takes some time at startup.
We have experienced long startup times on notbook <b>hard-drives</b>
with 5400 RPM disk rotation speed.</p>
<p>To reduce startup time uncheck the <i>Load Kegg and Biocarta
pathway data</i> box if you don't need pathways, this should make startup
faster by about 30%.</p>
<p>General data analysis mode is faster on startup, because it does
not need to load mappings for the different gene identifiers.</p>
<p>Caleydo uses about 200MB of <b>RAM</b>. Make sure that you have
sufficient RAM available, since paging (the use of your hard-drive as
virtual RAM) makes the application very slow. Try to close other
applications if this happens.</p>
<p>Since Caleydo uses 3D graphics extensively good graphics hardware
is essential. At least 64MB dedicated Video RAM are reccomended. We
reccomend NVidia graphics card, since all developers use them and they
therefore are the best-tested. ATI and Intel cards should also work, but
are tested less frequently.</p>
<p>A major issue is the quality of the graphics cards drivers. We
have seen many problems solved once our users updated their graphics
cards drivers to the latest versions.</p>
<p>If you have a slow graphics card, you can reduce the number of
samples you want to show in the parallel coordinates. The default value
is set to 1000 (File &gt; Preferences &gt; General). When reducing it
down to 200, the parallel coordinates can still provide meaningful
results while requiring much less preformance.</p>
<p>The quality of your CPU is mainly important for clustering, where
good hardware can speed up the process significantly.</p>
<p>Generally, to explore a whole genome set with about 40
experiments, such as the sample dataset, we recommend a computer not
build before 2006, with a hard drive with at least 7500 RPM, at least
2GB ram and 128 MB VRAM on a NVidia Geforce 7 or a ATI Radeon R500.</p>
<p>Smaller datasets can be explored with significantly less recent
hardware.</p>
