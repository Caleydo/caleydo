Visual Exploration and Analysis of Gene Expression Regulation</h1>

        <blockquote>
        <p>
An organism's DNA encodes all of the RNA and protein molecules required to
construct its cells. Yet a complete description of the DNA sequence of an
organism be it the few million nucleotides of a bacterium or the few billion
nucleotides of a human no more enables us to reconstruct the organism than
a list of English words enables us to reconstruct a play by Shakespeare. (Alberts2002).
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
How much of a protein is produced within a cell is defined by the <b>expression regulation</b> of individual genes. The information on how much of a protein should be produced is encoded in <b>regulatory DNA</b> which is interspersed in the DNA encoding the protein, in so-called non-coding regions. These regions bind to protein molecules that are present in the local cell and through that mechanism regulate how much of a specific protein is actually produced and therefore determine the function of a cell. 
</p>
<p>
The study of gene expression regulation is important as it can give clues to the function of a gene as well as information on which gene is involved in which type of process. Furthermore it can be a diagnostic tool. One can, for example, find out of which type of cancer a tumor sample is. This is due to the fact that the different cancer types have unique expression patterns. As a consequence targeted therapy is possible. Other applications include the study of the effects of drugs, personalized medicine and many more.
</p>
<p>
Traditionally gene expression analysis has been mainly a statistical task. However, the <b>Caleydo Team</b> believes that the visual analysis and exploration can provide additional insights into the data, and can help to discover new features of the data that are lost in a purely statistical approach. 
</p>
<p>
Currently <b>Caleydo</b> supports two types of visual gene expression analysis: Parallel Coordinates and Heat Maps. The former is a color representation of expression values, which allows to identify hot-spots and similarities.

</p>
<h1>Parallel Coordinates</h1>
<p>
   <img src="../../images/projects/gene_expression/pc.png" alt=
        "Parallel coordinates screenshot" style="border-style: none" align="right" />
        
        <b>Parallel Coordinates</b> are a well established method to visualize multi-dimensional data, however, they have been used sparsely for the visualization of gene expression regulation. Our implementation of parallel coordinates aims to be especially usable and explicitly targets the needs of gene expression analysis. 
        </p>
        <p>Among the key features are:
        
        <ul>
        <li>Several brushes (selection tools)</li>
        <li>Occlusion prevention techniques</li>
        <li>Axis and polylines can be exchanged, thus supporting different use cases</li>
        <li>Moving, removing duplication of axis</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        The main contribution of the system however, is the seamless integration of its different parts. The parallel coordinates provide several feature to support such an integration. More on that is described in <a href="#Integration">Integration of Multiple Visualizations</a> 
 </p>
 <h1>Heat Maps</h1>
 <p>
    <img src="../../images/projects/gene_expression/heat_map.png" alt=
        "Heat map screenshot" style="border-style: none" align="right" />
        A heat map is a visualization where the magnitude of a value is correlated to a color. The different values are arranged in rows and columns, corresponding to their meaning. Heat Maps are a standard way of visualizing gene expression regulation. Caleydo currently uses heat maps mainly to visualize contextual information, therefore the usually seen clustering of the elements is not yet implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
        Features of the heat map include:
        <ul>
        <li>Freely selectable color mapping</li>
        <li>Exchange of rows and columns to support different use cases</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        Again, the integration of the heat map with other parts is one of the areas the Caleydo project focuses on.
