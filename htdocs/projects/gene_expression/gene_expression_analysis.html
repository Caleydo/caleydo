<h1 class="red">Visual Exploration and Analysis of Gene Expression
Regulation</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>An organism's DNA encodes all of the RNA and protein molecules
required to construct its cells. Yet a complete description of the DNA
sequence of an organism be it the few million nucleotides of a bacterium
or the few billion nucleotides of a human no more enables us to
reconstruct the organism than a list of English words enables us to
reconstruct a play by Shakespeare (Alberts et al. Molecular Biology of
the Cell, 2002).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How much of a protein is produced within a cell is defined by the
<b>expression regulation</b> of individual genes. The information on how
much of a protein should be produced is encoded in <b>regulatory DNA</b>
which is interspersed in the DNA encoding the protein, in so-called
non-coding regions. These regions bind to protein molecules that are
present in the local cell and through that mechanism regulate how much
of a specific protein is actually produced and therefore determine the
function of a cell.</p>
<p>The study of gene expression regulation is important as it can
give clues to the function of a gene as well as information on which
gene is involved in which type of process. Furthermore it can be a
diagnostic tool. One can, for example, find out of which type of cancer
a tumor sample is. This is due to the fact that the different cancer
types have unique expression patterns. As a consequence targeted therapy
is possible. Other applications include the study of the effects of
drugs, personalized medicine and many more.</p>
<p>Traditionally gene expression analysis has been dominated by
statistics. However, the <b>Caleydo Team</b> believes that the visual
analysis and exploration can provide additional insights into the data,
and can help to discover new features that are lost in a purely
statistical approach.</p>
<p>Currently <b>Caleydo</b> supports two types of visual gene
expression analysis: <b>Parallel Coordinates</b> and <b>Heat Maps</b>.</p>

<h2>Parallel Coordinates</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/projects/gene_expression/pc.png"
	alt="Parallel coordinates screenshot" style="border-style: none; float: right;
padding-left: 1em;"/> <b>Parallel Coordinates</b> are a well established
method to visualize multi-dimensional data, however, they have been used
rarely for the visualization of gene expression regulation. Our
implementation of parallel coordinates aims to be especially usable and
explicitly targets the needs of gene expression analysis.</p>
<p>Among the key features are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Different brushes (selection tools)</li>
	<li>Occlusion prevention techniques</li>
	<li>Axis and polylines can be exchanged, thus supporting different
	use cases</li>
	<li>Moving, removing duplication of axis</li>
</ul>

<p>The main contribution of the <b>Caleydo Framework</b> however, is
the seamless integration of its different parts. The parallel
coordinates provide several features to support such an integration, see
<a href="#Integration">Integration of Multiple Visualizations</a> for
more information.</p>

<h2>Heat Maps</h2>
<p><img src="../../images/projects/gene_expression/heat_map.png"
	alt="Heat map screenshot" style="border-style: none; float: right;
padding-left: 1em;" />
A heat map is a visualization where the magnitude of a value is
correlated to a color. The different values are arranged in rows and
columns, corresponding to their meaning. Heat Maps are the standard way
of visualizing gene expression regulation. Caleydo currently uses heat
maps mainly to visualize contextual information, therefore the usually
seen clustering of the elements is not yet implemented.</p>
<p>Features of the heat map include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Freely selectable color mapping</li>
	<li>Exchange of rows and columns to support different use cases</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, the integration of the heat map with other parts is one of
the areas the Caleydo project focuses on.</p>

<h2>Integration of Multiple Visualizations</h2>
<p><a name="Integration" /></p>
<p><img src="../../images/projects/gene_expression/linked.png"
	alt="Heat map screenshot" style="border-style: none; float: right;
padding-left: 1em;"/>
In the Caleydo Project, we use the InfoVis paradigm of <b>multiple
linked views</b>, and take it to the next level, with the <b>Link Bucket</b>.
The Link Bucket is a concept that arranges 2D visualizations in a 2.5D
environment, thereby allowing a user to browse several visualization in
context with each other.</p>
<p><b>Visual Links</b>, which are lines drawn between selected
elements facilitate the easy identification of related elements in the
different representations. The <b>Link Bucket</b> thereby connects gene
expression information with pathways in a non-occluding and highly
informative and interactive way.</p>
<p>The gene expression visualizations such as the heat map are aware
of their current environment, only displaying as much information as
necessary and thereby avoid visual clutter. For example, only gene
expression data that is relevant in the context of the currently loaded
<a href="../pathways/pathways.html">pathways</a> is displayed.</p>
<p>For a detailed exploration of one view the <b>Link Bucket</b>
allows the user to zoom into the center view, thereby revealing all the
interaction features available in the stand-alone visualizations.</p>
<p>More information on navigation in the <b>Link Bucket</b> and on
loading new visualizations is available in the <a
	href="../pathways/pathways.html">pathways section</a>.</p>
