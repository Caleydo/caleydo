Various utilities and occasional Swing/UI used in JGraphpad.
</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
JGraphpad can't run without those utilities (else they are in a plugin). However, those sources can run independently from JGraphpad and don't import anything from the JGraphpad framework. Moreover, the difference between the coreframework and util is that class from util are "almost" independent one another. It's also tolerated it imports a few things from the ressource package.
