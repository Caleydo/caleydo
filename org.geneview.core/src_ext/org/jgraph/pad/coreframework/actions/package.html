Actions making the GUI of JGraphpad.
</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
To be used correctly by JGraphpad those actions require a empty public constructor so they can be loaded via Foo.class.newInstance(). Actions to be loaded are listed in the Graphpad.properties file. A good practise is to let your actions classes have parameters with getter and setters so that they can also be be triggered programmaticaly.
