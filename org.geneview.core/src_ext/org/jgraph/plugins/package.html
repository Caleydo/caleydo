Extra features that JGraphpad can invoke at run time (especially when GUI actions are triggered) but that aren't required for a minimal JGraphpad use. Some plugins depends on the JGraphpad framework while other features like layouts only depend on the JGraph library. Finally, some utility plugins are reusable components that have no dependence at all.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
THE JGRAPHPAD PAD PACKAGE MUST COMPILE WITHOUT ANYTHING FROM THE PLUGINS PACKAGE! Rather, plugins classes should be properly set via the XML settings file, the properties files, or even at run time. Such a loose coupling won't indeed break the compilation and anyone can then feel free to repackage JGraphpad as he wants, especially to achieve a scalable distribution. Moreover, normal distribution plugins are independent one another. Independence is enforced at build time.
