Codes to handle specific format export/imports. Ususally, exporting a graph rather than saving it will loose some information. Warning, some codecs depends on large libraries who may not been
included in the distribution (neither binarie, neither source) because it's making it too large
for too little added value. Especially, consider rebuilding the app with those libraries to get
features like SVG (batik lib) or PDF (i-text lib) exports.
