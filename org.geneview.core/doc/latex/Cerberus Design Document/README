Usage: read the files, everything is explained there (especially in demo.tex)

When writing slides, simply use slides.tex, with make handout or make slides both are made from the same source (slides.tex) => you need not bother about handout.tex and slides_main.tex

Make commands:

make: clean, compiles the document to pdf

view: clean, compiles the documents and opens acrobat reader with the document

slides: clean, compiles the slides

vslides: clean, compiles the slides and opens acrobat reader with the slides 

handout: clean, compiles the handout

vhandout: clean, compiles the handout and opens acrobat reader with the handout

clean: removes everything you do not need, copies temp files (~) to /tmp/

archive: clean, creates an archive with all files in it
