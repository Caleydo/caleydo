	Graphics (SVG). By integrating major bio-databases and searching
	pathway resources, ArrayXPath automatically maps different types
	of identifiers from microarray probes and pathway elements. When
	one inputs gene-expression clusters, ArrayXPath produces a list of
	the best matching pathways for each cluster. We applied Fisher's
	exact test and the false discovery rate (FDR) to evaluate the statistical
	significance of the association between a cluster and a pathway while
	correcting the multiple-comparison problem. ArrayXPath produces Javascript-enabled
	SVGs for web-enabled interactive visualization of pathways integrated
	with gene-expression profiles.},

  abstract = {Summary: ArrayXPath (http://www.snubi.org/software/ArrayXPath/) is
	a web-based service for mapping and visualizing microarray gene-expression
	data with integrated biological pathway resources using Scalable
	Vector Graphics (SVG). Deciphering the crosstalk among pathways and
	integrating biomedical ontologies and knowledge bases may help biological
	interpretation of microarray data. ArrayXPath is empowered by integrating
	gene-pathway, disease-pathway, drug-pathway and pathway-pathway correlations
	with integrated Gene Ontology, Medical Subject Headings and OMIM
	Morbid Map-based annotations. We applied Fisher's exact test and
	relative risk to evaluate the statistical significance of the correlations.
	ArrayXPath produces Javascript-enabled SVGs for web-enabled interactive
	visualization of gene-expression profiles integrated with gene-pathway-disease
	interactions enriched by biomedical ontologies.},

	The second, and for us more interesting approach, handles with the
