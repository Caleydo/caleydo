	for all the completely sequenced genomes and some partial genomes
	with up-to-date annotation of gene functions. The higher order functional
	information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical
	representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane
	transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database
	is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information
	about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded
	by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially
	useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is
	LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules
	and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing
	genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression
	maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph
	comparison and path computation. The KEGG databases are daily updated
	and made freely available (http://www. genome.ad.jp/kegg/).},

	algorithms for drawing metabolic pathways by dynamically querying
	the underlying knowledge base. These algorithms provide a foundation
	for building graphical user interfaces to metabolic databases. Pathway
	drawing is a graph-layout problem. Our algorithms draw pathways of
	several different topologies, including linear, cyclic, and branching
	pathways, as well as larger groupings of such pathways. The algorithms
	provide several visual presentations of metabolic pathways, for example,
	compounds can be drawn as names and/or chemical structures, and enzyme
	names and side compounds can be drawn or omitted. The GUI also provides
	several facilities for navigating in the space of biochemical pathways,
	such as traversing connections between pathways, and exploding or
	collapsing a pathway to include or exclude neighboring pathways.}
