The microarrays carried 37,530 human cDNA clones (human UniGene Set RZPD3.1, German Resource Center for Genome Research, Berlin, Germany). DNA fragments were amplified by PCR and spotted on epoxysilane glass slides (Quantifoil, Jena, Germany) using the VersArray ChipWriter Pro System (Biorad, Munich, Germany) and SMP3 pins (Telechem, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Spotting was performed in the division of Molecular Genome Analysis with a
spacing of 28x29 Spots in 4x12 Subarrays (top-down to left-right). After spotting, microarrays were rehydrated, and the DNA was denatured with boiling water prior to washing with 0.2% SDS, water, ethanol, and isopropanol. The arrays were dried with air pressure.

Dilated Cardiomyopathy and Non Failing Septal Biopsies

    <Summary>
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a common cause of heart failure and a leading cause of cardiac transplantation in western countries. The robust predictive expression profile of cardiomyopathic and NF hearts as well as the functional classification can help to identify promising candidates for DCM and may improve the early diagnosis of 
cardiomyopathy.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
This series includes dual channel hybridizations of 28 independent 
heart biopsy samples on Unigene3.1 cDNA Arrays. The 28 septal myocardial tissue samples were collected from 13 DCM hearts at the time of transplantation and 15 NF donor hearts which were not transplanted because of palpable coronary calcifications. For every independent sample, two technical replicates were performed and further processed as mean values.

    <Summary>
Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) represents a rare group of lesions with morphological features suggesting an inflammatory as well as a neoplastic nature. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by a chronic inflammation of the synovial tissue and a tumor-like proliferation (TLP) of synovial stroma cells. Osteoarthritis (OA) shows modest inflammatory infiltrates and no TLP.
All three diseases result in a progressive destruction of affected joints and remain a diagnostic difficulty because of nonspecific symptoms. This study aimed to identify molecular markers and genes correlated with the development of RA, OA, and PVNS using human whole genome cDNA microarrays and tissue samples obtained from knee surgery.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
This series includes dual channel hybridizations of 48 independent 
synovial membrane samples on Unigene3.1 cDNA Arrays. The 48 biopsies were collected from 18 patients with RA, 19 patients with OA and 11 patients with PVNS. For every independent sample, minimum of two technical replicates were performed and further processed as mean values.

DNA-Methyltransferases (DNMT) knockouts

    <Summary>
Alterations in DNA-methylation are a hallmark of human tumor cells. DNMT1 is expressed in three different splice variants and exhibits considerable preference for hemimethylated DNA and is therefore referred to as the maintenance methylase. DNMT3b is generally considered to be responsible for de novo methylation during embryonic development and probably also during tumor development. Recent studies using somatic knock-out of DNA-methyltransferases have shown a reduction in overall methylation and a re-expression of tumor suppressor genes. Cells deficient of both, DNMT1 and DNMT3b may exhibit almost complete demethylation and growth suppression. In the present study, we performed MEK-inhibition via U0126 treatment for the wildtype and every DNMT-knockout to focus on MEK/RAS-target genes regulated by methylation.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
This series includes dual channel hybridizations of 14 independent HCT-116
cell line lysates on Unigene3.1 cDNA Arrays. In this series, five DNMT-wildtype, three DNMT1-KO, three DNMT3-KO and three DNMT1 and 3B double KO were included with different treatment status (none, DMSO, U0126, Aza-CdR). For every independent sample, two technical replicates were performed and further processed as mean values.
