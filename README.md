Caleydo - Visualization for Molecular Biology
=============================================

Caleydo is a visualization framework for molecular biology data. It is targeted at analyzing multiple heterogeneous but related tabular datasets (e.g.,  mRNA expression, copy number status and clinical variables), stratifications or clusters in these datasets and their relationships to biological pathways.  

For user documentation and installation based on binaries please refer to the [Caleydo Website](http://caleydo.org). This guide assumes that you want to install Caleydo from source. 

Installation
============

Caleydo uses Java, OpenGL and the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP). Things you need to install before being able to run Caleydo: 

 * Eclipse Juno for RCP and RAP Developers, which you can get from the [eclipse download page](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/). *Other Eclipse versions won't work*. 
 * Java SDK >= 1.7

To install Caleydo use EGit within Eclipse and clone the repository. Each directory in the caleydo-dev folder corresponds to an Eclipse project. [Here](http://www.vogella.com/articles/EGit/article.html) is a good tutorial on how to import Eclipse projects from git.
