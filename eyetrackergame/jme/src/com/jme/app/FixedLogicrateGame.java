/**
 * A game that attempts to run at a fixed logic rate.
 * <p>
 * The main loop makes every effort to update at the specified rate. The goal
 * is to keep a consistent game-play speed regardless of the frame rate
 * achieved by the visuals (i.e. the game will render as fast as the hardware
 * permits, while running it's logic at a fixed rate). This gives tighter
 * control on how the game state is processed, including such things as AI and
 * physics.
 * <p>
 * The concept behind this is forcing every game logic tick to represent a
 * fixed amount of real-time. For example, if the logic is updated at a rate
 * of 15 times per second, and we have a person moving at 30 pixels per second,
 * each update the person should move 2 pixels. To compensate for the
 * non-constant frame rate, we smooth the visuals using interpolation. So, if
 * the scene is rendered twice without the game logic being updated, we do not
 * render the same thing twice.
 * <p>
 * Using a fixed time-step model has a number of benefits: game logic is
 * simplified as there is no longer any need to add time deltas to achieve
 * frame rate independence. There is also a gain in efficiency as the logic can
 * be run at a lower frequency than the rendering, meaning that the logic may
 * be updated only once every second game - a net save in time. Finally,
 * because the exact same sequence of game logic code is executed every time,
 * the game becomes deterministic (that is to say, it will run the exact same
 * way every time).
 * <p>
 * Further extension of this class could be used to integrate both a fixed logic
 * rate and a fixed frame rate.
