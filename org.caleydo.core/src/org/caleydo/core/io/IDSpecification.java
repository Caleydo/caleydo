/**
 * <p>
 * This class specifies an ID category and an ID type used for resolving
 * relationships in Caleydo. These IDs are typically specified in the headers of
 * the data matrices files.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Multi-dataset relationships and mappings are based on <b>definied
 * relationships between id types</b> (see {@link #idType} and {@link IDType}).
 * All ID types that can be <b>resolved to each other belong to the same id
 * category</b> (see {@link IDSpecification#idCategory} and {@link IDCategory}
 * ).That means, if two datasets containing shared IDs from two different files
 * are loaded, they can be mapped if the respective type is identical.
 * Alternatively, they can also be mapped if they do not have the same ID type
 * but the same ID category. This, however, requires that a mapping between the
 * ID types of the category was specified. An example for a mapping based on ID
 * categories are the genetic ID types defined in caleydo. As all genetic ID
 * types share the same ID category and a mapping between the ID types is
 * available, all genetic ID types can be mapped to each other.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Caleydo provides special types for gene identifiers using the ID category
 * "GENE". That means that if the rows or columns of the data matrix contain
 * gene identifiers, this needs to be specified using the
 * {@link #isColumnDataTypeGene} resp. the {@link #isRowTypeGene} members.
 * Additionally, the string for {@link #idType} can not be arbitrarily chosen,
 * but must be one of those listed below. Also, the ID category is automatically
 * considered to be "GENE" if this flag is true.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Caleydo uses the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources (see
 * http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) for ID Mapping. The supported ID Strings for
 * the respective types are the following:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>DAVID</code></li>
 * <li><code>GENE_NAME</code></li>
 * <li><code>GENE_SYMBOL</code></li>
 * <li><code>ENSEMBL_GENE_ID</code></li>
 * <li><code>ENTREZ_GENE_ID</code></li>
 * <li><code>REFSEQ_MRNA</code></li>
 * <li><code>BIOCARTA_GENE_ID</code></li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This IDSpecification also provides the ability to transform ID Types using
 * regular expressions. For details see the parent {@link IDTypeParsingRules}
 * </p>
