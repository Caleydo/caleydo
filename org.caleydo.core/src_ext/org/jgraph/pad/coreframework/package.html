Objects making the core of JGraphpad. If you want to take the control of JGraphpad to use it in a custom application, that's the package you need to learn along with JGraph. The subpackages of this package are more specific and you don't need to learn them deeply to reuse JGraphpad.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>
Those package sources can't be used without JGraphpad (without corrections). However, JGraphpad requires some classes from the upper package to run. The general policy for that core package is that it should be contributed under LGPL license (check if there is still some GPL files!). Indeed, when JGraphpad was fully GPL, it wasn't used that much. So we think that making the core LGPL could boost JGraphpad usage, including in business world. By thinking that core could be LGPL, you may feel much more comfortable to start serious projects because you know that if you want to make the effort, then you can to rewritte the few required GPL files and filter out those that ones you don't ever need. LGPL code can be linked with proprietary closed code or simply non GPL compliant code indeed. However, IT'S ILLEGAL TO DISTRIBUTE EXTENDED (SUBCLASSED) OR MODIFIED LGPL COVERED CODE WITHOUT PUBLISHING YOUR CHANGES/EXTENSIONS UNDER LGPL OR GPL. On the contrary, if ever you need to include one single GPL file, all statically linked distributed source code should be GPL compliant.
