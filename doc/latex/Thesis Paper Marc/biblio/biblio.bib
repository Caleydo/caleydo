  title = {Visualization methods for statistical analysis of microarray clusters.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most common method of identifying groups of functionally
	related genes in microarray data is to apply a clustering algorithm.
	However, it is impossible to determine which clustering algorithm
	is most appropriate to apply, and it is difficult to verify the results
	of any algorithm due to the lack of a gold-standard. Appropriate
	data visualization tools can aid this analysis process, but existing
	visualization methods do not specifically address this issue. RESULTS:
	We present several visualization techniques that incorporate meaningful
	statistics that are noise-robust for the purpose of analyzing the
	results of clustering algorithms on microarray data. This includes
	a rank-based visualization method that is more robust to noise, a
	difference display method to aid assessments of cluster quality and
	detection of outliers, and a projection of high dimensional data
	into a three dimensional space in order to examine relationships
	between clusters. Our methods are interactive and are dynamically
	linked together for comprehensive analysis. Further, our approach
	applies to both protein and gene expression microarrays, and our
	architecture is scalable for use on both desktop/laptop screens and
	large-scale display devices. This methodology is implemented in GeneVAnD
	(Genomic Visual ANalysis of Datasets) and is available at http://function.princeton.edu/GeneVAnD.
	CONCLUSION: Incorporating relevant statistical information into data
	visualizations is key for analysis of large biological datasets,
	particularly because of high levels of noise and the lack of a gold-standard
	for comparisons. We developed several new visualization techniques
	and demonstrated their effectiveness for evaluating cluster quality
	and relationships between clusters.},
