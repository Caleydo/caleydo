[Interesting term: post-genomics - paper: Tracking the Shift to postgenomics]

Tool that supports biologists and pathologists to understand the results of their experiments.

%Some types of cancer are suspected to either originate in or else being influenced by genetic disposition. Though human DNA has been examined and broken down to sequences of genes the meaning of most genes and their influence on each other is still unknown. The Cerberus application enables doctors to get an overview over patients' gene-expression data as well as clinical data like the history of the disease. It uses clustering techniques to provide information visualization, thereby allowing doctors to systematically search for coincidences. The aim of this thesis is to extend the application with a metabolic pathway module to take the connection between metabolic pathways and genes into account.
