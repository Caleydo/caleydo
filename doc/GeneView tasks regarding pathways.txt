GeneView TASKS regarding pathway part
=====================================

- ViewRep
  - Extend Date Explorer (PW list, view list, maybe also update structure)
  - MIDI interface + Mixer ViewRep
  - ViewRep for creating new Sets/Storages
    Problem: How to assign new data to views? How should view know what to do with data?

- 2D PathwayViewer
  - Connection of pathway nodes to foreign nodes (concept!)
  - Mouse-over item highlighting (+ identical visible items)
  - Correct pathway neighborhood visualization (i.e. indirect connections)
  - New JGraph pathway layer view
  - Semantic-zoom, collapsing (concept!) - also in OpenGL

- Data structure
  - Implementing selections data structure (for pathways, heatmaps, scatterplots)
  - Enyzme -> Gene mapping (request a special mapping from Mr. Asslaber)
  - New edge implementation to consider multiple connections
  - Search for Enzyme/Compound/Gene + highlighting

- OpenGL pathways
  - Multiple pathway layer view - including cross-references
  - OpenGL pathway update (e.g. on neighborhood visualization in JGraph pathway)
  - Improve OpenGL pathway view (styles, alignment, etc.)
  - Pathway image loading in OpenGL pathway view (TGA - with transparency)
  - Cone Tree concept (some kind of)  

- WEKA
  - Integration of pathway data
  - Dendrogram data structure

- Research
  - Further research to keep global view on topic
  - Papers: When should we start? What can we publish? Where can I participate?
  - Meeting with LKH partners - find out useful pathway/heatmap scenario

- Others
  - Progress bar on application bootstrapping (sticky)
  - Command Serialization (for exporting/saving and network app.)
  - Multiple work station setup
  - Multi-monitor setup - including new input devices
