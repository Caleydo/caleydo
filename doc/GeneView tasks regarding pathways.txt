GeneView TASKS regarding pathway part
=====================================

- Further research to keep global view on topic
- Implementing selections data structure (for pathways, heatmaps, scatterplots)
- MIDI interface + Mixer ViewRep
- Enyzme -> Gene mapping (request a special mapping from Mr. Asslaber)
- Extend Date Explorer (PW list, view list, maybe also update structure)
- New edge implementation to consider multiple connections
- OpenGL pathway layers - including cross-references
- Mouse over ("Hot-Spot") ?
- Semantic-zoom (concept!)
- WEKA integration of pathway data
- Command Serialization (for exporting/saving and network app.)
- New JGraph pathway layer view
- OpenGL pathway update (e.g. on neighborhood visualization in JGraph pathway)
- Connection of pathway nodes to foreign nodes (concept!)
- ViewRep for creating new Sets/Storages (problem!)
- Progress bar on application bootstrapping (sticky)
- Improve OpenGL pathway view (style sheets, alignment, etc.)
- Correct pathway neighborhood visualization (i.e. indirect connections)
- Cone Tree concept (some kind of)
- Search for Enzyme/Compound/Gene + highlighting
- On mouse-over item highlighting (+ identical visible items)
- Dendrogram data structure
- Pathway image loading in OpenGL pathway view (TGA - with transparency)
- Papers: When should we start? What can we publish? Where can I participate?
- Meeting with LKH partners - find out useful pathway/heatmap scenario
- Multiple monitor setup - including new input devices
- Multiple work station setup
