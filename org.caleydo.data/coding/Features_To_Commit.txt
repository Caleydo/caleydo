Done since last commit:

Added build.xml to org.caleydo libs, and target Run Copy Libs to External tools. By executing that all the libs are copied to core, rcp and gleem.
PCs now use GL_LINE_STRIPS instead of GL_LINES to render lines, except when rendering a selection. Then they still use GL_LINES because they need to draw the value information.
Using static import now for renderstyle, makes GLRenderStyle.STATIC_MEMBER unnecessary.
Implemented random sampling for HeatMap and PCs
Changed constructor of VirtualArray to take List instead of ArrayList, and consequently the interfaces in the set as well
Removed several CaleydoRuntimeExceptions
