Cleanup in AGlStorageBased and PCs

Added different View Types to EManagedObjectType (HeatMap, PCs, Pathways etc..)
Added type field to AGLEventListener. Every view now has to set its type in the Constructor.
Modified EPickingType to hold a reference to the view responsible for the action there.
Modified the checkForHits in AGLEventListener to check only for Hits that are relevant for the view, based on the aforementioned modifications.
