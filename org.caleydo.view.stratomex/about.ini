aboutText=Caleydo StratomeX is a visualization technique for the analysis of multiple stratified datasets. A good example for such an analysis scenario is the <b>identification and characterization of cancer subtypes</b>. Understanding subtypes is a precondition for refined therapeutic targeting which in turn is an important step towards improved patient outcomes. Recent research has shown that integrated analysis of different molecular data types generated by the TCGA project can be used to discover subtypes and suggest molecular differences relevant for therapeutic approaches.
