aboutText=Biological pathways represent an important source of information when investigating experimental data in the context of cellular processes. Therefore different approaches try to visually combine pathways and experimental data. However, existing solutions are either limited in the way that only few experiments can be associated with pathway nodes, or that pathways and their structure are not represented appropriately.%n%nThis issue is addressed in our interactive visualization technique enRoute, which can be used to explore large amounts of experimental data along a selected path of nodes. Paths can dynamically be extracted from pathway maps to be shown side-by-side with experimental data. enRoute is capable of simultaneously visualizing hundrets of samples that can originate from several datasets and are grouped by different experimental conditions.
